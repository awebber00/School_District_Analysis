# School_District_Analysis
## An analysis of schools in a district
### Purpose of Analysis
I was tasked with helping Maria perform an analysis of schools in a particular district. The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria and myself for help.
