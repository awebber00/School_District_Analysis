# School_District_Analysis
## An analysis of schools in a district
### Purpose of Analysis
I was tasked with helping Maria perform an analysis of schools in a particular district. The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria and myself for help.

## Results: 
### Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

    1. How is the district summary affected? 
       1a. The district summary is affected by replacing the reading and math scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School with NaN.
    2. How is the school summary affected?
       2a. There is an overall general decrease of about 1% when the data is updated and analyzed in the challenge.ipynb 
    3. How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
       3a. Thomas High School is the only school significantly changed by re-analyzing the data from the PyCitySchools.ipynb. The data relative in the other schools remained unchanged. The changes were seen in the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Overall Passing. The changes ranged from 25%-30%.
    4. How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
       - Math and reading scores by grade: No changes were displayed.
       - Scores by school spending: Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected the schools with spending in the $630-$644 range as shown below.
       - Scores by school size: Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected the Math and Reading Scores by School Size in the Medium bin.
       - Scores by school type: Replacing the ninth-grade scores affected the Math and Reading Scores by School Type in the Charter school data.

 ## Summary: 
 ### Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs:
 
 Four changes in the updated district analysis are: Percentage differences of about 25%-30% in the Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Passing Math, Passing Reading, and Overall Passing categories, changes in the schools with spending in the $630-$644 range, changes in the Math and Reading Scores by School Size in the Medium bin, and changes in the Math and Reading Scores by School Type in the Charter school data.
